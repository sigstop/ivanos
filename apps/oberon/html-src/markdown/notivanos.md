What is not IvanOS?
====================

Unlike open source distributed compute resource managers like
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and
[Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) (Docker), IvanOS is focused on emerging
data intensive, analytic intensive, potentially widely distributed
applications.  IvanOS is not focused on deployment, scaling, and
consolidation of legacy applications or traditional three-tiered web
applications.

Unlike distributed analytics platforms like
[Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), IvanOS is focused on streaming data
applications rather than applications which start with specific “data at
rest” (i.e.  data sitting on distributed disks).

Like some proprietary cloud orchestration platforms (e.g.  Google PaaS,
Amazon AWS, Facebook platform, and Microsoft Azure), IvanOS unifies
network and compute scheduling at a findamental level.

Like Google’s platform and Amazon’s Kinesis, IvanOS fundamentally supports
applications which may exhibit massive concurrency which is more
sophisticated than the embarrassingly parallel MapReduce method.
