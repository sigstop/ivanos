Where is the code?
====================

Most of the actual IvanOS source code is in [GitHub](https://github.com)

Right now it is broken into various pieces in different GitHub
repositories (aka repos) that each reference or includes lots of other
open source GitHub repositories and possibly some open source code which
is not in GitHub at all.

But that's what happens when you start re-defining network based
computing.

What we have right now is:

* The [top level IvanOS repo](https://github.com/sigstop/ivanos) (that doesn't do much)
* The [top level system interfaces and operational
  tools](https://ivanos.org/doc/system/)
* The core [networking components from
  FlowForwarding](https://github.com/FlowForwarding)
* more to come...

Click here to go to the code.  This repo contains the IvanOS portal code,
the top level system interfaces and operational tools.  It also aggregates
most of the key system components.
