<h1>What is not IvanOS?</h1>

<p>Unlike open source distributed compute resource managers like
<a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> and
<a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Mesos</a> (Docker), IvanOS is focused on emerging
data intensive, analytic intensive, potentially widely distributed
applications.  IvanOS is not focused on deployment, scaling, and
consolidation of legacy applications or traditional three-tiered web
applications.</p>

<p>Unlike distributed analytics platforms like
<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>, IvanOS is focused on streaming data
applications rather than applications which start with specific “data at
rest” (i.e.  data sitting on distributed disks).</p>

<p>Like some proprietary cloud orchestration platforms (e.g.  Google PaaS,
Amazon AWS, Facebook platform, and Microsoft Azure), IvanOS unifies
network and compute scheduling at a findamental level.</p>

<p>Like Google’s platform and Amazon’s Kinesis, IvanOS fundamentally supports
applications which may exhibit massive concurrency which is more
sophisticated than the embarrassingly parallel MapReduce method.</p>
